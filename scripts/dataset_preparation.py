"""
This module loads high-resolution (HR) and low-resolution (LR) image pairs, preprocesses them by converting 
to Y channel from YCrCb color space and resizing, and then saves the processed images into numpy arrays.
The mapping between HR and LR images is retrieved from a JSON file, and the processed images are stored in a 
compressed .npz file.
